# Turbidity-Detection
Turbidity detection of muddy water
Turbidity detection technique implemented with sampled turbidity images. 
The dataset contains the images extracted from turbidity samples.
Features extracted from the dataset is given in the csv file. Features and the turbidity values are normalized.
The dataset turbidity values are assumed as the water testing is pending. The assumption is made by visual comparison with standard
turbidity images available over internet.
The dataset turbidity value distribution is as given below.
Images Im1 -Im130 ~ 0 NTU, Im131-Im340  -5.0 NTU,
Im341-Im540 - 10.0 NTU, Im541- Im700 - 50.0 NTU,
Im701 - Im840 - 100.0 NTU, Im841 -Im1010 -250.0 NTU
